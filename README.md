# FoodFast

## About the Project
Full stack web application built with Javascript, Express, AJAX, Twilio API, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3 and PosgreSQL.

### Problem Statement

An application built to simplify online food ordering for pickup.

### Expected Usage

Desired users are restaurant owners and customers:
- Restaurant owners can register and login to see their orders. They will recieve a phone call every time an order is made online.
  - They can then either accept or decline the order.
  - Over the phone, they specify how long the order will take to prepare.
  - This triggers a notification to the customer with estimated preparation time via SMS.
  - The restaurant owner can then see the orders online, with a countdown timer based on the estimated preparation time.
  - They can mark an order as complete when the food has been prepared, which sends a notification to the customer.

- Customers can order from the restaurant menu online.
  - They are notified when the order has been accepted and how long it will take.
  - They are notified again when the food is ready.

## Getting Started
